## Project Overview
This  aims to create a dashboard that analyzes building occupancy trends over time. It uses data from multiple buildings and spaces to help identify trends, compare occupancy rates, and detect unusual patterns.

## Objective
The goal is to provide useful insights into how different spaces are utilized by:
Tracking occupancy over time.
Identifying trends, peaks, and dips in occupancy.
Comparing occupancy rates with space capacity.
Monitoring the flow of people entering and exiting buildings.
Detecting unusual occupancy patterns or anomalies 

## Key Visualizations and Metrics
Occupancy Over Time: Shows how occupancy changes across different buildings or spaces to spot trends.
Peak Occupancy: Compares peak occupancy across spaces to find underused or overused areas.
Occupancy Rate vs Capacity: Visualizes how efficiently spaces are used compared to their full capacity.
Traffic Over Time: Tracks the number of people entering and exiting buildings.
Occupancy Anomalies: Detects when occupancy is unusually high or low compared to the average.
Space Utilization Efficiency: Measures how efficiently a space is being used over time.
